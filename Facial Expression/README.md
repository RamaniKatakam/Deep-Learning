Facial Expression Recognition -The dataset given contains facial expression images. It has 28,709 examples for training and 3,589 examples for testing. The dataset consists of 48x48 pixel gray scale images of faces. Faces are registered so that they are more or less centered and occupies about the same amount of space for each face. The attached file input.csv contains three columns, “emotion”, “pixels” and “usage”. The ‘emotion’ column contains numeric codes, 0 and 1. Codes 1 and 0 are for ‘happy’ and ‘not happy’ cases, respectively. The “pixels” column contains a string surrounded in quotes for each face. The contents of this string are space-separated pixel values in row major order. The third column “usage” mentions the purpose, i.e., whether for “training” or “testing”. In the input file, each face is numbered with that particular row number. The task is to categorize each face either happy or not happy based on the emotion shown in facial expression.
