Prediction of Zomato restaurant ratings- EDA, Feature Extraction, Model Building
    - The challenge is to predict the user ratings of Zomato restaurants in major cities. Problem Statement Given a dataset with 39 variables such as average cost for two and cuisines offered for each observation in the training data, the objective is to suggest the user ratings of a particular listing using the 38 features provided for the test observations. The suggested ratings that are closest to the true ratings, as calculated by the Root Mean Squared Error.Code file consists of EDA, feature extraction, regression models on important features extracted through VIF(Variance Inflation Factor) Method.

Facial Expression Recognition
    -The dataset given contains facial expression images. It has 28,709 examples for training and 3,589 examples for testing. The dataset consists of 48x48 pixel gray scale images of faces. Faces are registered so that they are more or less centered and occupies about the same amount of space for each face. The attached file input.csv contains three columns, “emotion”, “pixels” and “usage”. The ‘emotion’ column contains numeric codes, 0 and 1. Codes 1 and 0 are for ‘happy’ and ‘not happy’ cases, respectively. The “pixels” column contains a string surrounded in quotes for each face. The contents of this string are space-separated pixel values in row major order. The third column “usage” mentions the purpose, i.e., whether for “training” or “testing”. In the input file, each face is numbered with that particular row number. The task is to categorize each face either happy or not happy based on the emotion shown in facial expression.

Deep Learning model for Image Classification
    -Zip Folder contains train and test data folders with sub image folders. Flattened the data from the folders and preocessed it. Built Deep Learning model using Torch and classified test data images.
